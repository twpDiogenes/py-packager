Contributions rules are simple.

Once we agreed on the techstack, each collaborator will create their own branch from this one `dev` and make a pull request whenever they added new functionnality

Commit messages must follow the wise pattern which is the following:

1- Minor changes were made
[update_type][target]: [short summary of what was done]

2- Major changes were made
[update_type][target]: 
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body> Detailed explanation of what was changed and why
<BLANK LINE>
<footer> Short summary of what might break/not work properly after the update
```
